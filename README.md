# Salary Increase in Python
This program calculates the salary increase for an employee, given the employee's current salary, the percentage increase, and the number of years of service. The program also formats the currency in the Brazilian model, with two decimal places and a comma as the decimal separator.

The program takes two inputs:

- Current salary: The employee's current salary, in international model.
- Percentage increase: The percentage increase in salary, integer number without % symbol.
  
The program outputs the employee's new salary, formatted in the Brazilian model.
